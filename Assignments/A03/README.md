## BST Delete Method
### Daniel Granados
### Description:

This is an addition to the program thats being worked in class. I was tasked to add a delete method to our binary search tree code. I added the neccessary syntax to utilize this method, there are 4 cases; the first is if the value being delete can't be found in the tree. The second case is if the root doesn't have a child. The third case is if the root only have one child. The last case is if the root has two children. I added a helper function: "findMin" and its purpose is to find a suitable replacement value to maintain the properties of a binary search tree.

### My code: 
```
Node* findMin(Node* node) {
    while (node && node->left) node = node->left;
    return node;
}


Node* _Delete(Node* root, int x) {
    if (!root) return root;  // Base case: key not found

    if (x < root->data)
        root->left = _Delete(root->left, x);  // Search in left subtree
    else if (x > root->data)
        root->right = _Delete(root->right, x);  // Search in right subtree
    else {
        // Case 1: Node has no child (leaf)
        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            delete root;
            return nullptr;
        }

        // Case 2: Node has only one child
        else if (!root->left) {
            Node* temp = root->right;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        else if (!root->right) {
            Node* temp = root->left;
            delete root;
            return temp;
        }
        // Case 3: Node has two children
        Node* temp = findMin(root->right);  // In-order successor
        root->data = temp->data;  // Copy successor value
        root->right = _Delete(root->right, temp->data);  // Delete successor
    }
    return root;
}
```

### Example of how findmin works 
Before deleting 50
```
        50
       /  \
     30    70
    /  \   /  \
   20  40 60  80

```
To Delete 50; (has two children).
- Find the in-order successor, which is the smallest node in the right subtree â†’ findMin(70) returns 60.
- Replace 50 with 60.
##### This is the end result: 
```
        60
       /  \
     30    70
    /  \     \
   20  40    80

```
