## BST Delete Method
### Daniel Granados
### Description:

This is an addition to the program thats being worked in class. I was tasked to add a delete method to our binary search tree code. I added the neccessary syntax to utilize this method, there are 4 cases; the first is if the value being delete can't be found in the tree. The second case is if the root doesn't have a child. The third case is if the root only have one child. The last case is if the root has two children. I added a helper function: "findMin" and its purpose is to find a suitable replacement value to maintain the properties of a binary search tree.
