| A slab of shale was gifted to MSU from the Colwell Creek Pond by the Whiteside Museum of Natural History. After utilizing fossil preparation methods to split and expose the plant fossils located in the slab, it was discovered that the Slab had a fossil from the Permian Age, which was 22 million years before the first dinosaurs walked the earth. Present literature provides a look at the deposital environment of the time as well as other flora found in the area. This along side the fossiled plant can be used to create a display for the student body in the new Bolin Science Hall. |
